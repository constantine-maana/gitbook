# For Developers

Developers are mainly responsible for connecting the data and then creating the knowledge microservices. Collaborating with Architects during the Domain and Function modeling stage, developers then take the kinds and functions that were created and connect the data via UI or programmatically. 

Once the data is connected, Developers must then decide if theyâ€™re going to build their knowledge microservice from scratch, or if they will wrap an existing service. Upon deployment of the knowledge microservice, they connect any bots and assistants, then finish up by building out the Knowledge App.
