# Role Guides

It may come as a surprise to you that Maana is not a platform meant only for Developers. While it's true that having one place to find your organization's re-usable encoded knowledge will enable an easier time for Developers, the Maana Q Platform is designed to make sure that the people who are not interested in coding or haven't coded for a while \(e.g. a subject matter expert, a business analyst, etc.\), have a big part to play in building out the solutions and digitizing the knowledge in their organization.

In the graphic below and in the pages that follow, you will find Role specific information and recommendations that will help to inform your role and your activities on the Platform.
