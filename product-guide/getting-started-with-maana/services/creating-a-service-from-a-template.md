# Creating a Service from a Template

Any valid GraphQL service can be created and added to the Q Service Catalog.  To accelerate new service creation, Maana provides a set of [boilerplate project templates](https://github.com/maana-io/q-templates) in a variety of languages, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, C\#, Python, etc.  These templates may be cloned directly from the GitHub repository or the [Maana CLI's](https://github.com/maana-io/q-cli) `mcreate` command can be used.
