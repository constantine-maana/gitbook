## Question

#### Will public Stack Overflow users be able to see my Team?

Stack Overflow for Teams is intended to be a private space for your team to ask questions without worry it'll be made public. But you might still have some questions about how it works.

* If I post a question, answer or comment in this Team, will that be visible to people not on the Team? Will it show up in my profile somehow? Can Stack Overflow moderators see our content?
* Will my membership in this Team be shown on my public profile?
* Is our content safe from hackers?

## Answer

Teams on Stack Overflow are implemented on strictly segregated database schemas. Content on a Team can not be seen by anyone who is not signed up for your Team. That includes high-reputation users, moderators and even employees of Stack Overflow. Some employees have access to anonymous metadata about your Team, but that's limited under our terms of service and because we respect your privacy. It's our Prime Directive for Teams.

Nobody outside your Team can see that you are a member. Earning 200 reputation on the Team will grant you an [association bonus](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/141648/what-is-the-association-bonus) if you haven't already earned it on another site on the network. But there's no indication of where you earned it.

We're always on guard against unauthorized access to private data. One step we take is to hire outside security experts who test our systems and look for vulnerabilities.
