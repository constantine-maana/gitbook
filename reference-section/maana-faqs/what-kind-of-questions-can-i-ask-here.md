### What kind of questions can I ask here?

Stack Overflow has a fairly strict standard for [on topic questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/on-topic). Do those standards apply to this Team?

## Answer

Not necessarily. This is **your Team and your space** to use however you see fit. So you can feel more free to ask:

* about a problem when you don't yet know all the details needed for a solution,
* questions that could be asked on the public site, but might be tailored for your organization,
* open-ended or resource recommendation questions, or even
* non-programming questions relevant to your Team.

If you see a question **asked over and over**, that's an ideal time to post the question \(and, ideally, an answer\) here. That way, you can share a link instead of composing a new answer each time. When new people join your organization, they are likely to have questions about how to get started. This is a great place to keep that sort of documentation so that anyone can edit or improve it. It's also an ideal way to [document a process](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520) for your own reference in the future.

It can even be helpful to ask questions _about the site_, like this one!

No matter what you ask, remember that **the best questions are clear and specific**.
