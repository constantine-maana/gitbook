#### What are the best practices for tagging?

Tags are vital for organizing questions so that they can be found later. They also make it possible for you to [follow and search particular topics](http://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000042022-following-and-watching-tags).

What tags are available to use and where are they located? What practices should be followed when using and creating tags?

## Answer

To help people looking for your question in the future \(including your future self!\), use existing tags if they apply. Remember that a question can have up to 5 tags, so use any that might be helpful for your team. If appropriate, include a tag for product lines, specific projects, or internal teams that are relevant to the question.

* The tags from the public Stack Overflow site are available for you convenience, so your Team can follow the same pattern of using [technology-specific tags](https://stackoverflow.com/tags).
* Team-specific tags can be found by clicking on the Tags link in the left sidebar under your Team.

You can also [create a new tag](http://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000042018-creating-new-tags) if needed - just type the name of the tag into the box. Edit the description of a tag by clicking on it and selecting "Improve tag info" - this information can help others determine what the tag is for and how it should be used. For more tag tips, [see the help pages](http://www.stackoverflow.help/support/solutions/articles/36000042016-using-tags).
