# Where can I find common Kinds for reuse and interop?

## Question

#### Where can I find common Kinds for reuse and interop?

There are a set of common concepts, properties, relations, and entities that are found in everyday life, such as: people, places, things, time, physical quantities, digital media \(e.g., documents, images, web pages\), etc.

Knowledge Services should build on each other instead of reimplementing common concepts \(e.g., Person, Address, Email\). \(See related: [How do I specialize another service's Kinds?](https://stackoverflow.com/c/maana/questions/23)\)

What are the core set of Maana Knowledge Services I should look at to help me maximize reuse and contribute to shared knowledge?
