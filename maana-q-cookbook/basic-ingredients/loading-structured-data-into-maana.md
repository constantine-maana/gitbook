# Loading Structured Data into Maana

To load structured data into Maana:

* Create or select the workspace where you want to load data. 
* Go to the **Workspaces** tab and either create a Workspace or open a Shared Workspace/Template.
* Select the **Upload File** button. 
* Select the file\(s\) you would like to add. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: It is also possible to simply drag and drop files into the **Canvas** area to upload them into the current workspace. The platform currently supports the CSV file format, with more file types to be supported in the near future. 
{% endhint %}

* The uploading file\(s\) will appear on the canvas while a **Progress** indicator in the Explorer tab shows that the file is being processed.

Following the completion of the upload process, the system will generate: 

* **Raw Data Kind**\(s\) – Data Kind representing files that were uploaded into Maana and their corresponding metadata.

* **Interpreted Kind**\(s\) – Kinds generated from the Raw Data Kind following parsing by Maana bots/microservices. 

Loading data into a **Raw Data Kind** triggers automatic parsing by Maana bots, resulting in the creation of an **Interpreted Kind**, and possibly other subsequent Kinds \(e.g. People Names, Company, etc.\) and connections between them, including: 

* **Field Classifications**: Interpretations of individual fields and their values against known Kinds and Instances \(e.g., People, Places, Organizations, Categorical\).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: The Field Classifier bot can suggest that an Entity called **Company Name** is of the type **Company**, where **Company** is a known Kind describing companies doing business in the US. 
{% endhint %}

* **Entity Extraction**: Analysis of comments, descriptions, or whole documents to identify mentions of entities, values, and facts.

* **Interpreted Kinds** have a schemas including Entities that make up that Kind and their suggested Field Types - which can be detected by a Maana Field Classifier microservice as Generic Field Types \(e.g. String, Integer, etc.\) or as Kind Types.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Example**: Interpreted Kinds appear in blue, with sample instances showing in the Visualization tab. 
{% endhint %}

* **Relations between Kinds** - Maana suggested Relations and/or Dependencies within the associative network. The Business Analyst can review and validate them as part of the Kind Visualization and Curation process.

Maana also offers the option to load multiple files via [CLI](https://github.com/maana-io/q-cli).  See section [the following section](01b-loading-structured-data-through-the-cli.md) for instructions.
