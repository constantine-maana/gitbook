# What is best practice for shared state across multiple knowledge services?

## Question

#### What is the best practice for shared state \(e.g., ML models\) across multiple knowledge service instances?

As a Knowledge Service developer, where should I store binary state I generate and use across multiple instances?

For example, a machine learning service \(scaled to, say, 6 instances\) will train and apply custom models \(some serialized representation\).

Assume Azure. Is there a best practice?

## Answer

\[TBD\]
